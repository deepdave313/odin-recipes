        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g chicken (drumsticks or boneless pieces)</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk (or ½ cup yogurt + ½ cup water)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional, for color)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for spice)</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup cornstarch (for extra crispiness)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
            <li>Oil (for deep frying)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix buttermilk, salt, black pepper, and half of the garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces and let them marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for better flavor).</li>
            <li>In another bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, paprika, cayenne, onion powder, and the remaining garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan to 175°C (350°F).</li>
            <li>Take each marinated chicken piece, dip it into the beaten eggs, then coat it in the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Shake off excess flour and carefully place the chicken into the hot oil.</li>
            <li>Fry for 8-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove and drain on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
